  "description": "The extension is imagined as a tool for broadening
  ones awareness of accessibility and the structure of the digital
  built environment. This extension add a subsequent layer to the
  already existing web, to visualize parts of the source code that
  would otherwise be hidden for non-screen reader users, and to
  forefront inaccessible elements. Elements with green labels are
  marked as accessible, pink marks elements where the
  accessibility of the element is not clearly determined, and
  elements marked in red defines inaccessible elements. This extension
  shows a specific perspective on accesibility, as it is defined from
  the choices of the author of what to mark and what not to mark.",
